<h3>
<span>COWLEY AND GRAY, NO. III.</span>
</h3>


<p>Before again recurring to Gray's partiality for the poems of Cowley, I
will make a remark or two on Mr. Wakefield's edition of Gray.</p>

<p>In his delightful "Ode to Adversity" Gray has written:</p>

<div class="poem">

    <p>  "Daughter of Jove, relentless power,</p>
       <p class="i3"> Thou tamer of the human breast,</p>
    <p>  Whose <i>iron scourge, and tort'ring hour</i>,</p>
      <p class="i3">  The bad affright, afflict the best."</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Upon which Wakefield gives us this brilliant criticism:</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "'Torturing hour.' There seems to be some little impropriety and
   incongruity in this. <i>Consistency</i> of figure rather required some
   <i>material</i> image, like <i>iron scourge</i> and <i>adamantine chain</i>."</p>

<p>Afterwards he seems to speak diffidently of his own judgment, which is
rather an unusual thing in Mr. Wakefield. Well would it have been for
the reputations of Bentley, Johnson, and Wakefield, that, before
improving upon Milton and Gray and Collins, they had remembered the
words of a truly great critic, even Horace himself:</p>

<div class="poem">

      <p>"Sunt delicta tamen quibus ignovisse velimus:</p>
      <p>Nam neque chorda sonum reddit quem vult manus et mens,</p>
      <p>Poscentique gravem persæpe remittit acutum;</p>
      <p>Nec semper feriet quodcunque minabitur arcus.</p>
      <p><i>Verum ubi plura nitent in carmine, non ego paucis</i></p>
      <p><i>Offendar maculis, quas aut incuria fudit,</i></p>
      <p><i>Aut humana parum cavit natura.</i>"</p>

     <p class="author"> <i>Epist. ad Pisones</i>, 347.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Not by any means that I am allowing in this case the existence of a
"macula," or an "incuria" either. To D'Israeli's <i>Curiosities of
Literature</i> I think I am indebted for the remark, that Gray borrowed the
expressions from Milton:</p>

<div class="poem">

                    <p class="i7">"When the <i>scourge</i></p>
      <p>Inexorably, and <i>the torturing hour</i></p>
     <p> Calls us to penance."</p>

      <p class="author"><i>Par. Lost</i>, lib. ii. 90.</p>

</div>


<p>It is therefore with Milton, and not with Gray, that Mr. Wakefield must
settle the matter. And in proof of my earnest sympathies with him during
the very unequal contest, I will console him with "proprieties,"
"congruities," "consistencies of figure," and "material images," enough.</p>

<div class="poem">

      <p>"The lifted axe, the agonizing wheel,</p>
     <p> Luke's iron crown, and Damien's bed of steel."</p>

      <p class="author">Goldsmith's <i>Traveller</i>, ad finem.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Or better for this purpose still:</p>

<div class="poem">

      <p>"Swords, daggers, bodkins, bearded arrows, spears,</p>
        <p class="i1">Nails, pincers, crosses, gibbets, hurdles, ropes,</p>
     <p> Tallons of griffins, paws and teeth of bears,</p>
      <p class="i1">Tigre's and lyon's mouths, not iron hoops,</p>
      <p>Racks, wheels, and trappados, brazen cauldrons which</p>
  <p>Boiled with oil, huge tuns which flam'd with pitch."</p>

     <p class="author"> Beaumonts's <i>Psyche</i>, cant. <span class="smcap lowercase">XXII.</span> v. 69. p. 330.
      Cambridge, 1702. Folio.<a id="Page_466"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[466]</span></p>

</div>



<p>"Torturing hour" is used by Campbell in his <i>Pleasures of Hope</i>, Part
I.:</p>

<div class="poem">

    <p>  "The martyr smiled beneath avenging power,</p>
      <p>And braved the tyrant in his <i>torturing hour.</i>"</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">And, indeed, "sweetest Shakspeare, Fancy's child," had used it before
any of them:</p>

<div class="poem">

     <p> "Is there no play, to ease the anguish of a torturing hour."</p>

      <p><i>Midsummer Night's Dream</i>, Act V. Sc. 1.</p>

</div>

<p>Again, Gray writes in his truly sublime ode, "The Bard:"</p>

<div class="poem">

     <p> "On a rock, whose haughty brow</p>
        <p class="i3">Frowns o'er old Conway's foaming flood,</p>
     <p> Robed in the sable garb of woe,</p>
        <p class="i3">With haggard eyes the poet <i>stood</i>,</p>
     <p> (Loose his beard, and hoary hair</p>
     <p>Stream'd, like a meteor, to the troubled air),</p>
     <p> And with a master's hand, and prophet's fire,</p>
     <p>Struck the deep sorrows of his lyre."</p>

</div>

<p>Ordinary readers would have innocently supposed the above "pictured"
passage beyond all praise or criticism. "At non infelix" Wakefield:</p>

<div class="poem">

      <p>"A falcon, tow'ring in her pride of place,</p>
      <p>Was by a mousing owl hawk'd at and kill'd."</p>

      <p class="author"><i>Macbeth.</i></p>

</div>

<p>I must give his note as it stands, for I question whether the whole
range of verbal criticism could produce anything more ludicrous:</p>

 <p class="blockquot">  "I wish Mr. Gray could have introduced a more poetical
   expression, than the inactive term <i>stood</i>, into this fine
   passage: as Shakspeare has, for instance, in his description of
   <i>Dover cliff</i>:</p>

<div class="poem">

                         <p class="i7"> 'Half way down</p>
      <p><i>Hangs</i> one, that gathers samphire; dreadful trade!'</p>

      <p class="author"><i>King Lear</i>, Act IV. Sc. 6.</p>

</div>

 <p class="blockquot"> "Which is the same happy picture as that of Virgil:</p>


<div class="poem">

   <p> "'Dumosa <i>pendere</i> procul de rupe videbo.'</p>

      <p class="author"><i>Ecl.</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">I.</span> 77."</p>

</div>



<p>He might, when his hand was in, have adduced other passages also from
Virgil, <i>e.g.</i>:</p>

<div class="poem">

      <p>"Imminet in rivi præstantis imaginis undam."</p>

     <p class="author"> <i>Culex</i>, 66.</p>

</div>

<p>However, with all due respect for Mr. Wakefield's "happy pictures," I do
not see anything left, but his eyebrows, for the luckless bard to <i>hang
by</i>! He could not have <i>hung</i> by his <i>hair</i>, which "stream'd like a
meteor to the troubled air;" nor yet by his <i>hands</i>, which "swept the
deep sorrows of his lyre." Besides, there can scarcely be more opposite
pictures than that of a man gathering samphire, or kids browsing,
amongst beetling rocks; and the commanding and awe-inspiring position in
which Gray ingeniously places his bard. The expressions chosen by
Virgil, Shakspeare, and Gray were each peculiarly suitable to the
particular objects in view. If Gray was thinking of Milton, as I
intimated in a former letter, he may have still kept him in mind:</p>

<div class="poem">

     <p>"Incens'd with indignation, Satan <i>stood</i></p>
     <p>  Unterrify'd, and like a comet burn'd,</p>
     <p>That fires the length of Ophiuchus huge</p>
     <p> In the Arctic sky, and from his horrid hair</p>
     <p> Shakes pestilence and war."</p>

     <p class="author"> <i>Par. Lost</i>, lib. ii. 706.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Or again:</p>

<div class="poem">

             <p class="i5">     "On th' other side, Satan, alarm'd,</p>
     <p> <i>Collecting all his might dilated stood</i>,</p>
     <p> Like Teneriff or Atlas unremov'd:</p>
     <p> His stature reach'd the sky, and on his crest</p>
     <p> Sat Horror plum'd; nor wanted in his grasp</p>
     <p> What seem'd both spear and shield."</p>

     <p class="author"> <i>Par. Lost</i>, lib. iv. 985.</p>

</div>

<p>It would be easy to adduce similar instances from the ancient sources,
but I will only mention From Milton an illustration of the
<span title="[Greek: systrepsas]">&#963;&#965;&#963;&#964;&#961;&#949;&#968;&#945;&#962;</span> of Demosthenes, and of the passionate abruptness with which
Gray commences "The Bard:"</p>

<div class="poem">

      <p>"As when of old some orator renown'd</p>
      <p>In Athens or free Rome, where eloquence</p>
      <p> Flourish'd, since mute, to some great cause addressed</p>
      <p> <i>Stood in himself collected</i>, while each part,</p>
      <p>Motion, each act won audience ere the tongue,</p>
      <p><i>Sometimes in height began, as no delay</i></p>
      <p><i> Of preface brooking through his zeal of right</i>."</p>

<p>Wakefield's hypercritical fastidiousness would have completely defeated
the intentions of Gray. His "Bard" had a mission to fulfil which could
not have been fulfilled by one suspended like king Solomon, in the
ancient Jewish traditions, or like Mahomet's coffin, mid-way between
heaven and earth. His cry was <span title="[Greek: dos pou stô]">&#948;&#959;&#962; &#960;&#959;&#965; &#963;&#964;&#969;</span>, and the poet heard
him. And thus, from his majestic position, was not&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

     <p> "Every burning word he spoke</p>
     <p> Full of rage and full of grief?"</p>

</div>

<p>In the full blaze of poetic phrensy, he flashes out at once with the
awfully grand and terrible exordium:</p>

<div class="poem">

     <p> "Ruin seize thee, ruthless king!</p>
       <p class="i3"> Confusion on thy banners wait!</p>
     <p> Tho' fann'd by conquest's crimson wing,</p>
       <p class="i3"> They mock the air with idle state.</p>
     <p> Helm, nor hauberk's twisted mail,</p>
       <p class="i3"> Nor e'en thy virtues, Tyrant, shall avail</p>
      <p>To save thy secret soul from nightly fears,</p>
      <p>From Cambria's curse, from Cambria's tears."</p>

</div>

<p>Collins thus describes the passion of <i>anger</i>:</p>

<div class="poem">

<p>"Next Anger rush'd;&mdash;his eyes on fire,</p>
        <p class="i3">In lightnings own'd his secret stings:</p>
      <p>In one rude clash he struck the lyre,</p>
       <p class="i3"> And swept with flurried hand the strings."</p>

</div>

<p>Word-painting can go no farther. When, however, he comes to
<i>melancholy</i>, in lines which contain more suggestive beauty, as well as
more poetic <i>inspiration</i>, than perhaps any others of the
<a id="Page_467"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[467]</span> same
length in the English language, how does he sing?</p>

        <p class="i3"> In notes, by distance made more sweet,</p>
      <p>Pour'd thro' the mellow horn her pensive soul:</p>
        <p class="i3"> And, dashing soft from rocks around,</p>
        <p class="i3">Bubbling runnels join'd the sound;</p>
      <p>Through glades and glooms the mingled measure stole,</p>
      <p>Or o'er some haunted stream with fond delay,</p>
        <p class="i3">Round a holy calm diffusing,</p>
        <p class="i3">Love of peace, and lonely musing,</p>
      <p>In hollow murmurs died away."</p>

<p>This is the concentrated essence of poetry. Surely Gray had <i>forgotten</i>
Collins when he penned the beautiful lines:</p>

<div class="poem">

    <p>"But not to one in this benighted age,</p>
      <p class="i3">Is that diviner inspiration given,</p>
    <p> That burns in Shakspeare's or in Milton's page,</p>
      <p class="i3">The pomp and prodigality of heaven,</p>
    <p>As when conspiring in the diamond's blaze,</p>
      <p class="i3">The meaner gems, that singly charm the sight,</p>
    <p> Together dart their intermingled rays,</p>
      <p class="i3">And dazzle with a luxury of light."</p>

<p>From a memorandum made by Gray himself, it is evident that he once had
contemplated placing his "Bard" in a <i>sitting</i> posture; but I cannot but
rejoice that he altered his mind, for such breath-taking words could
never have been uttered in so composed and contented a posture. I give
part of it from Mr. Mason's edition:</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "The army of Edward I., as they marched through a deep valley,
   are suddenly stopped by the appearance of a venerable figure,
   <i>seated</i> on the summit of an inaccessible rock; who, with a voice
   more than human, reproaches the king with all the misery and
   desolation he had brought on his country, &amp;c., &amp;c. His song
   ended, he precipitates himself from the mountain, and is
   swallowed up by the river that rolls at its foot."&mdash;Vol. i. p.

<p>Wakefield dwells enraptured on the expression <i>human passions</i>. Cowley
speaks of "<i>humana quies</i>" (<i>Davideidos</i>, lib. i. p. 3.). Horace says:</p>

<p><i>Human passions</i> is not, however, a <i>creation</i> of Gray's; for, if not
anywhere else, he might have found the words very often in the writings
of William Law, as vigorous a prose writer as England can boast of since

<h3>
<span>OLD SONG: THE CUCKOLD'S CAP.</span>
</h3>


<p>The following song I never saw in print. I knew an old lady, who fifty
years ago used to sing it. Is it known?</p>

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">

     <p>Near Reading there lived a buxom young dame,</p>
      <p>The wife of a miller, and Joan was her name;</p>
      <p>And she had a hen of a wondrous size,</p>
      <p>The like you never beheld with your eyes:</p>
      <p>It had a red head, gay wings, yellow legs,</p>
      <p>And every year laid her a bushel of eggs,</p>
      <p>Which made her resolve for to set it with speed,</p>
      <p> Because she'd a mind to have more of the breed.</p>

</div>

<div class="stanza">

      <p>Now as she was setting her hen on a day,</p>
      <p>A shepherd came by, and thus he did say:</p>
      <p>"Oh, what are you doing?" She answered him then,</p>
      <p>"I'm going to set my miraculous hen."</p>
      <p> "O, Joan," said the shepherd, "to keep your eggs warm,</p>
      <p> And that they may prosper and come to no harm,</p>
      <p> You must set them all in a large cuckold's cap,</p>
      <p>  And then all your chickens will come to good hap."</p>

</div>

<div class="stanza">

 <p> "O, I have no cuckold's cap, shepherd," said she,</p>
     <p> "But nevertheless I'll be ruled by thee;</p>
     <p> For this very moment I'll trudge up and down,</p>
     <p> And borrow one, if there be one in the town."</p>
      <p>So she went to the baker's, and thus she did say:</p>
      <p>"O, lend me a cuckold's cap, neighbour, I pray,</p>
     <p> For I'm going to set my miraculous hen,</p>
      <p>And when that I've done with't, I'll bring it again."</p>

</div>

<div class="stanza">

    <p>  The baker's wife answered, and thus she replied:</p>
     <p> "Had I got such a thing, you should not be denied;</p>
     <p> But these nineteen or twenty years I have been wed,</p>
    <p>  And my husband ne'er had such a cap to his head.</p>
      <p>But go to my cousin, who lives at the mill,</p>
    <p>     I know she had one, and she may have it still;</p>
     <p> Tell her I sent you, she'll lend it, I know."</p>
    <p>  "Thank ye," says Joan, and away she did go.</p>

</div>

<div class="stanza">

   <p>   So, straight to the house of the miller she went,</p>
     <p> And told her that she by her cousin was sent,</p>
     <p> To borrow a thing which was wondrous rare,</p>
     <p> 'Twas a large cuckold's cap, which her husband did wear.</p>
     <p> "I do not dispute but such things there may be;</p>
      <p>But why should my cousin, pray, send you to me?</p>
    <p>  For these nineteen or twenty years I've been a wife,</p>
      <p>And my husband ne'er had such a cap in his life.</p>

</div>

<div class="stanza">

  <p> "But go to the quaker who lives at the Swan,</p>
    <p>  I know she had one, and if 'tisn't gone,</p>
      <p>Tell her to lend it to you for my sake,</p>
     <p> Which I the same for a great favour shall take."</p>
    <p>  So she went to the house of old Yea and Nay,</p>
      <p>And said to his wife, who was buxom and gay,</p>
      <p>"I'm come for to borrow, if that you will lend,</p>
     <p> A large cuckold's cap: I was sent by a friend."</p>

</div>

<div class="stanza">

     <p> The quaker's wife answered and said, with a frown,</p>
    <p>  "Why, I've no such thing, if thou'dst give me a crown;</p>
     <p> Besides, I'd not lend it, friend Joan, if I had,</p>
    <p>  For fear it should make my old husband run mad.</p>
      <p>In town there are many young damsels, perhaps,</p>
     <p> Who may be ingenious in making these caps,</p>
     <p> But as for their names, I really can't say,</p>
      <p>So, therefore, friend Joan, excuse me, I pray."</p>

</div>

<div class="stanza">

     <p> Now Joan being tired and weary withal,</p>
      <p>She said, "I've had no good fortune at all.</p>
     <p> I find that it is the beginning of sorrow,</p>
      <p>To trudge up and down among neighbours to borrow.</p>
      <p>A large cuckold's cap I wanted indeed,</p>
      <p>A thing of small value, and yet couldn't speed:</p>
     <p> But, as I'm a woman, believe me," says Joan,</p>
      <p>"Before it be long, I'll have one of my own."</p>

<h3>
<span>THE GODODIN.</span>
</h3>

<p>This poem, though not absolutely the earliest in point of date, is the
longest of the numerous poems produced among the Kymry of the north of
England during the sixth and seventh centuries. Two translations have
already appeared in English; one by the Rev. Edward Davies, the author
of <i>Celtic Researches</i>, and the other by a gentleman named Probert. Of
these the latter, though very imperfect and extremely defective, is the
only one which an English reader should consult; the version given by
Davies is only a very ingenious misrepresentation. The poem has no more
reference<a id="Page_469"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[469]</span> to Hengist than it has to the man-in-the-moon; and
G<span class="smcap lowercase">OMER</span> might have suspected that a version which, without rule or reason,
deprived historic personages of their reality, could not have been
correct. <i>Every proper name mentioned in the Gododin may be shown
without any alteration to be those of persons living between 577 and
642.</i> The proof of this assertion, when carefully examined, is all but
overwhelming; but here I can only cite a few of the most tangible facts.
The design of the poem is thus described by the bard himself:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

  <p class="i3">"O ved O vuelin,</p>
  <p class="i3">  O Gattraeth werin,</p>
  <p class="i3"> Mi a na vi Aneurin</p>
  <p class="i3">  Ys gwyr Taliesin,</p>
  <p class="i3"> Oveg cyvrenhin</p>
  <p class="i3">  Neu cheing Ododin</p>
  <p class="i3">Cyn gwawr dydd dilin."</p>

</div>

<p>These lines may be thus translated:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

     <p> "Of mead from the mead horn,</p>
     <p>  Of the host of Cattraeth,</p>
     <p> I, Aneurin, will do</p>
     <p>  What is known to Taliesin,</p>
     <p> A man of kindred disposition.</p>
     <p>Will I not sing of what befell</p>
     <p>Gododin, before the break of day?"</p>

</div>


<p>From frequent notices in other parts of the poem, we find that the
subject is the defeat of (the Ottadini) the men of Gododin, in a battle
which took place in the year 603, near Cattraeth, which may be
identified with the Cataracton of Ptolemy, the Cataract of Bede, and the
present Catterick in Yorkshire. The men of Gododin in this campaign were
in league with the Novantæ of Wigtonshire, the Britons of Strathclyde,
the Scots of Argyle, and the Picts of Fife and Perth. Of this army the
chiefs alone amounted to three hundred and sixty; but, to use the words
of the bard, "Mead brought shame on the best of armies;" and the chiefs,
on account of temporary success over a part of Ethelfrith's Northumbrian
army, spent the night in wild carousal. Overtures of peace were made to
them by Ethelfrith, and contemptuously rejected; they rushed pell-mell
to battle <i>before the break of day</i>; and the bard, seeing them falling
helplessly drunk from their horses, "drew a veil over his face and fled,
weeping on his way." I here assume that Cattraeth and Cataract are the
same place; and to cite only one of many evidences, the position of the
Ottadini in the immediate neighbourhood of Catterick, lends this view
strong confirmation. But there is here another assumption, to which I
invite the attention of English antiquaries. The <i>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i>
relates the occurrence of a great battle between Ethelfrith of
Northumbria and the northern Britons in the year 603: of that battle the
site is variously named Degstan, Dægsanstane, and Egesanstane; but
antiquarian researches have not determined where Egesanstane was. Some
place it at Dawston, near Jedburg, in Scotland, and others at Dalston in
Cumberland; but all confess uncertainty. Now I assume that the place
called Egesanstane is more likely to be Siggeston, in the North Riding
of Yorkshire, which is about five or six miles east of Catterick; and
this conjecture is strongly supported by the fact that Ethelfrith in
this case was not the invader but the invaded, as it is said, "Hering,
the son of Hussa, led the enemy thither," to the dominions of
Ethelfrith, which were then but little else than the eastern coast of
Northumberland and Yorkshire. If this view be correct, our antiquaries
have hitherto been in error on this point; the site of the great battle
of 603 is no longer unknown; and Egesanstane and Cattraeth are only two
names for the same battle, just as another battle-field is variously
named the battle of Waterloo by us, and that of Mont St. Jean by the
French.</p>

<p>Probert places the death of Aneurin in 570: the Gododin shows him to
have been an eyewitness of an event which took place in 642. Davies,
whose works are striking evidences of a powerful intellect completely
led astray, makes the subject to have been the reported massacre at
Stonehenge, which possibly never took place, but which he fixes in 472.
Now I have cited a passage which, referring to Taliesin as an authority,
implies that Aneurin was his junior; and Taliesin was living in 610.
Again, Davies makes an abortive attempt to get rid of the last poem of
Llywarch Hen, which shows him to have been living as late as the year
640, when most of his sons had fallen in battle. Llywarch himself was
either at the battle of Cattraeth, or assisted in organising the
campaign; for though not mentioned by Aneurin, he himself alludes to the
time "when we attacked the great-smoker-of-towns (Ethelfrith)."</p>

<p>At this battle Aneurin was taken prisoner, and confined in "an earthen
house," from which he was released "by the bright sword of Cenau, the
son of Llywarch." The son of Llywarch could scarcely have been living in
472; and Davies in vain essays to get rid of this obdurate fact. This
passage in Aneurin&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

     <p> "Under foot was gravel,</p>
     <p> Stretched out was my leg</p>
     <p> <i>In the subterranean house</i>,</p>
     <p>And an iron chain</p>
     <p> Was bound about my knees,"</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">shows the use of under-ground hovels to have extended far into the
historic period.</p>

<p>One fact more, and this demonstration that Aneurin has been ante-dated
will be complete. The bard in three several places mentions a battle of
Mannan, in much the same way as we at this day speak of Waterloo; and it
is evident that, in the estimation of the bard and his countrymen, the
battle of Mannan was the last great event<a id="Page_470"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[470]</span> before the battle of
Cattraeth. The first of these passages is&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

     <p class="i3"> "Caeawe Cymnyviat cyvlat Erwyt</p>
     <p class="i3"> .    .    .    .    .</p>
     <p class="i3"> Rae ergit <i>Cadfannan</i> catwyt."</p>

</div>

<div class="poem">

      <p>"<i>Caeog</i> was a conflictor with destructive pikes.</p>
        <p>  .    .    .    .    .   </p>
   <p>   He was preserved from the blows of Mannan-fight."</p>

</div>

<p><i>Cæog</i>, whom Davies converts into the adjective "adorned," was the
brother of Cynddylan, Prince of Powys (<i>Elegies of Llywarch Hen</i>, p.
70.). On the death of his brother in 577, he went to North Briton; he
escaped from the blows of Mannan, and <i>afterwards</i> fell at Cattraeth.
Again, of a chief named Twrch it is said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

     <p> "He loved the battling of spears,</p>
  <p>     At Mannan, and before Aldud the renowned."</p>

</div>

   <p class="i3"> "Emyt af crennyt y gat waewawr</p>
   <p class="i3">  Catvannan yr Aelut clodvawr."</p>

</div>


<p class="noindent">Again he says of another chief:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

   <p class="i3"> "Yn dieding . . . . .</p>

      <p>He was an impetuous rider that morning."</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Here we have three separate proofs of the fact, that Cadvannan was
anterior to the battle of Cattraeth: now when and where did that take
place? In the year 582, and probably at Clackmannan, on the Firth of
Forth in Scotland. Here is my authority (<i>Annals of Ulster</i>):</p>

   <p class="blockquot">"DLXXXII. Bellum Manan, in quo victor erat Aodhan Mar Gawran."</p>

<p>The battle of Cattraeth must be that of 603, at which Aeddan was also
present.</p>

<p>These few annotations from a new translation of <i>The Gododin</i> now in

justified in repeating the views of Davies. Should he wish to get a
correct text, and a judicious version of <i>The Gododin</i>, he had better
subscribe to a translation by the Rev. J. Williams (author of the

<span>FOLK LORE.</span>
</h3>



<p><i>Lincolnshire Folk Lore.</i>&mdash;The following, illustrating as it does a
superstition still very prevalent in Lincolnshire, may interest some of
your readers. I transcribed it a few days ago in the British Museum from
Holly's <i>Lincolnshire Notes</i>, vol. iii. fol. 358.:&mdash;</p>


 <p class="blockquot">  "The other I receaued from Mr. Thomas Codd, minister of Laceby in
   Linc, w&#265;h he gave under his owne hand; he himself being a
   native of ye place where this same happened, and it was thus:</p>

 <p class="blockquot">  "At Axholme, alias Haxey, in ye Isle, one Mr. Edward Vicars
   (curate to Mr. Wm. Dalby, vicar), together with one Robert
   Hallywell a taylor, intending on St. Marke's even at night to
   watch in ye church porch to see who shoud die in ye yeare
   following (to this purpose using divers ceremonies), they
   addressing themselues to the busines, Vicars (being then in his
   chamber) wished Hallywell to be going before and he would
   p&#349;ently follow him. Vicars fell asleep, and Hallywell
   (attending his coming in ye church porch) forthwith sees certaine
   shapes p&#349;nting themselves to his view, resemblances (as he
   thought) of diuers of his neighbours, who he did nominate; and
   all of them dyed the yeare following; and Vicars himselfe (being
   asleep) his phantome was seen of him also, and dyed with ye rest.
   This sight made Hallywell so agast that he looks like a Ghoast
   ever since. The lord Sheffield (hearing this relation) sent for
   Hallywell to receiue account of it. The fellow fearing my Lord
   would cause him to watch the church porch againe he hid himselfe
   in the Carrs till he was almost starued. The number of those that
   died (whose phantasmes Hallywell saw) was as I take it about
   fower score.</p>

<h3>
<span class="bla">Minor Notes.</span>
</h3>

<h4>
<span><i>Modern Greek Names of Places.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;It is commonly stated in books of
geography that the modern name of Athens is <i>Statines</i>. In Hennin's
<i>Manuel de Numismatique Ancienne</i> it is stated to be <i>Satines</i> or
<i>Atini</i>; and Mr. Akerman, in his most excellent <i>Numismatic Manual</i>,
makes the same statement. We find it stated also universally that the
modern name of Cos is <i>Stanco</i>; and this has been repeated in all maps
and charts until the recently published Admiralty Chart, No. VI. of the
Archipelago series, where it is called <i>Cos</i>.</p>

<p>The origin of this and other similar blunders is curious. Athens retains
its plural termination, and is always used with the article,
<span title="[Greek: hai Athênai]">&#945;&#953; &#913;&#952;&#951;&#957;&#945;&#953;</span>. If you ask a peasant walking from the Piræus whither he is
going, he will answer you,
<span title="[Greek: Eis tas Athênas]">&#917;&#953;&#962; &#964;&#945;&#962; &#913;&#952;&#951;&#957;&#945;&#962;</span>, but will rapidly
enunciate it as follows,
<span title="[Greek: 's't'sAthênas]">'&#963;'&#964;'&#963;&#913;&#952;&#951;&#957;&#945;&#962;</span>, whence <i>Statines</i>,
lately reduced to <i>Satines</i>.</p>

<p>I am surprised that Cos was not set down as <i>Stinco</i> rather than
<i>Stanco</i>, for if you hail a Coan vessel, and ask whither it is bound,
the
<span title="[Greek: karaboukyri]">&#954;&#945;&#961;&#945;&#946;&#959;&#965;&#954;&#965;&#961;&#953;</span>, or skiff-master, would certainly reply
<span title="[Greek: stên Kô]">&#963;&#964;&#951;&#957; &#922;&#8179;</span>, if Cos were his destination.</p>

<p>I find that both M. Hennin and Mr. Akerman assert that Thebes is now
called <i>Stives</i>. I conversed with a noble-looking youth on the ruins of
Eleusis, and asking him from what part of the country he came, I shall
not easily forget the<a id="Page_471"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[471]</span> stately dignity with which he tossed his
capote over his shoulder, and answered
<span title="[Greek: eimi Thêbaios]">&#949;&#953;&#956;&#953; &#920;&#951;&#946;&#945;&#8055;&#959;&#962;</span>&mdash;I am a
Theban. The bold B&oelig;otian would have stared in amazement had I spoken
to him of <i>Stives</i>, although, if homeward-bound, he would have said he
was going
<span title="[Greek: 's tas Thêbas]">'&#963; &#964;&#945;&#962; &#920;&#951;&#946;&#945;&#962;</span>.</p>

<p>The Turks have made Istambol or Stamboul out of
<span title="[Greek: stên polin]">&#963;&#964;&#951;&#957; &#960;&#959;&#955;&#953;&#957;</span>; and
we may, perhaps, hear from our friends, the Nepaulese ambassadors, that
the capital of England is called <i>Tolondon</i>, and that of France <i>Apari</i>.</p>

<h4>
<span>"<i>There is no mistake.</i>"</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;The Duke of Wellington's reply to Mr.
Huskisson, "There is no mistake," has become familiar in the mouths of
both those who remember the political circumstances that gave rise to
it, and those who have received it traditionally, without inquiring into
the origin of it. You may perhaps think it worthy of a "Note" that this
was not the first occasion on which the Duke used those celebrated
words. The Duke (then Earl of Wellington) in a private letter to Lord
Bathurst, dated Flores de Avila, 24th July, 1812, writes in the
following easy style:</p>

<p>   "I hope that you will be pleased with <i>our</i> battle, of which the
   dispatch contains as accurate an account as I can give you.
   <i>There was no mistake</i>, everything went on as it ought; and there
   never was an army so beaten in so short a time."</p>

<p>The whole letter is well deserving of insertion; but my object is simply
to draw attention to the occasion on which the Duke first used the
sentence now so well known.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Remarkable Prophecy.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;The following prediction of St. Cæsario, Bishop
of Arles, in the year 542, may not be considered void of interest at the
present moment. It is taken from a book, entitled <i>Liber Mirabilis</i>,
printed in Gothic characters, and deposited in the Royal Library,
Paris:&mdash;</p>

<p>   "The administration of the kingdom, France, will be so blended,
   that they shall leave it without defenders. The hand of God shall
   extend itself over them, and over all rich; all the nobles shall
   be deprived of their estates and dignity; a division shall spring
   up in the church of God, and there shall be two husbands, the one
   true, and the other adulterous. The legitimate husband shall be
   put to flight; there shall be great carnage, and as great a
   profusion of blood as in the day of the Gentiles. The universal
   church and the whole world shall deplore the ruin and destruction
   of a most celebrated city, the capital and mistress of France.
   The altars of the temple shall be destroyed, the holy virgins
   outraged shall fly from their seats, and the whole church shall
   be stripped of her temporal gods; but at length the black eagle
   and the lion shall appear hovering from far countries. Misery to
   thee, O city of philosophy! thou shalt be subjected! A captive
   humbled even to confusion, shall at last receive his crown, and
   destroy the children of Brutus."</p>

<span><i>The Ball that killed Nelson</i> </span>

   <p class="blockquot">"The musket-ball that killed Nelson is now in the possession of
   the Rev. F. W. Baker, of Bathwick, near Bath. A considerable
   portion of the gold lace, pad, and silk cord of the epaulette,
   with a piece of coat, were found attached to it. The gold lace
   was as firmly fixed as if it had been inserted into the metal
   while in a state of fusion. The ball, together with the lace,
   &amp;c., was mounted in crystal and silver, and presented by Captain
   Hardy to the late Sir William Beattie, the surgeon of the
   Victory."</p>


<p>I have extracted this from the <i>Illustrated London News</i>, First Number.

<h3>
<span>SUPPRESSED EPILOGUE BY DRYDEN.</span>
</h3>

<p>Mr. Payne Collier communicates to the <i>Athenæum</i> of the 22nd November,
1851, an interesting letter relative to an unspoken epilogue to Dryden,
and Nat Lee's famous tragedy of <i>The Duke of Guise</i>. This rare
composition, entitled "Another Epilogue intended to have been spoken to
the Play before it was forbidden last Summer, written by Mr. Dryden,"
occurs in conjunction with the Prologue and Epilogue which were actually
spoken, upon a separate sheet of foolscap; in which shape, as Mr.
Collier informs us, they were often printed for sale at the playhouse
doors. Mr. Collier's acceptable communication suggests a Query or two.
At the end of my copy of this play, the 4to. edit. of 1687, is the
following</p>


  <p class="blockquot"> "A<span class="smcap lowercase">DVERTISEMENT</span>.</p>

  <p class="blockquot">  "There was a Preface intended to this play, in vindication of it,
   against two scurrilous libels lately printed. But it was judged,
   that a defence of this nature would require more room than a
   preface would reasonably allow. For this cause, and for the
   importunity of the stationers, who hastened their impression,
   'tis deferred for some little time, and will be printed by
   itself. Most men are already of opinion that neither of the
   pamphlets deserve an answer, because they are stuffed with open
   falsities, and sometimes contradict each other; but, for once,
   they shall have a day or two thrown away upon them, tho' I break
   an old custom for their sakes, which was to scorn them."</p>

<p>Was this threatened preface ever issued? Are the "two scurrilous libels"
here spoken of so scornfully, known to be in existence?</p>

<p>The new-found Epilogue belongs as much to the political as to the
dramatic history of those troublous times; and let us hope, <i>maugre</i> the
unfortunate coarseness of the school to which it belongs, that Mr.
Collier will some day present us with a reprint of it <i>in toto</i>,
accompanied by the above noted preface, if it exist. There is ample
matter, as the pages of "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>" have lately shown, for a new
volume of Dryden Miscellanies.</p>

<h3>
<span>Minor Queries.</span>
</h3>

<h4>
<span>332. <i>Barrister.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Can any of your correspondents refer me to the etymon
of this name, given to a vocation attached to our English courts of law?
I can find none even in the comprehensive <i>Etymological Dictionary</i> of
Nat. Bailey, unless, indeed, by dividing the word into two portions,
viz. "bar" and "rister," and then, with a little of the critic's
license, assuming that the latter half might originally have been
written "roister." But as this analysis would <i>render</i> it so little
characteristic of the class so named, and would strongly imply that some
portion at least of that distinguished body was once viewed as the
"roisters," <i>i.e.</i> "bullies and blusterers," of that division of our
courts called "the Bar," it is evident that we cannot reasonably look
for the derivation of the latter part of the word from that source. But
still, as there may be those who are inclined, in spite of these cogent
objections, to doubt whether this may be its true etymon; and it is fit
that any such lurking and slanderous suspicion should be dispelled from
every sceptic mind, some one of your curious and learned correspondents,
anxious to effect it, will, perhaps, tax his etymological skill to the
suggestion of a less offensive, and more just and appropriate
derivation, than "Bar-roister."</p>

<h4>
<span>333. <i>Indian Jugglers.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Can any of your readers favour me with
references to any works containing an account of the trick practised by
jugglers in the East Indies, and known there by the name of "growing a
mango?" In performing this trick a seed is planted in a pot or basket of
earth, which is then covered up from the sight by a cloth or other wire;
in a little time this is removed, and the seed is seen to have
germinated, and its growth is similarly shown in successive stages, the
last of which exhibits the plant in fruit. Hundreds of Europeans have
seen the trick, but I have never heard of any one who was able to detect
the successive substitutions in which it obviously consists. I do not at
present recollect the name of any author who takes any notice of it.</p>

out; in the copies in which it appears it is the twelfth stanza, and is
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&mdash;In a small volume of Sacred Poetry, in the
possession of a friend of mine, the following lines on the Bible are
ascribed to Byron:</p>

<div class="poem">

 <p>"Within this awful volume lies</p>
     <p>  The mystery of mysteries;</p>
     <p> Oh! happiest they of human race</p>

     <p> To hear, to read, to fear, to pray,</p>
     <p> To lift the latch, and force the way:</p>
     <p> But better had they ne'er been born</p>
     <p>Who read to doubt, or read to scorn."</p>

<span>344. <i>Parish Registers&mdash;Right of Search&mdash;Fees claimable.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Considerable
attention has of late<a id="Page_474"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[474]</span> been excited with reference to the
difficulties attending the ordinary means of access to various public
depositories of documentary evidence in this country. In some of these
departments, the commencement of a welcome reform is already apparent;
others, it is but reasonable to hope, will, ere long, yield to the frank
and inquisitive spirit of the times in this respect. The present
communication is confined to a very wide, though less dignified source
of official information, viz. Parish Registers. I am sure I need not say
one word to illustrate the importance of the last-mentioned class of
evidence to the genealogist, the topographer, or the archæological
inquirer in general,&mdash;in one word, to those who enter into the spirit of
the "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>." I beg, therefore, to submit the following
inquiries:</p>

<p>1. Have the actual parishioners of a place a right to consult their own
register of baptisms, marriages, and burials, <i>gratuitously</i>? If not:&mdash;</p>

<p>2. What fee is <i>legally</i> demandable,&mdash;and by whom,&mdash;and under what
restrictions? And&mdash;</p>

<p>3. Do the terms differ when the inquirer is not a <i>parishioner</i>? If so,
in what respect do they differ?</p>

<p>These inquiries have reference to the contents of the chests kept in, or
in connection with, parochial churches and chapels, and not to those in
the custody of the modern "Registrar." I need scarcely add, that my
concern is with the strictly <i>legal</i> rights of search, and demand of
fees; and not as to what courtesy may concede, or usage sanction.</p>

autograph, from which to make a copy to illustrate it? It is not to be
found in the British Museum. The extreme paucity of information
respecting this worthy is somewhat strange, considering the value of his
contributions to literature. In our leading biographies and cyclopædias
his name does not occur. By-the-bye, where was he buried, and what
inscription is there on his "funeral monument?"</p>

<p>An etched portrait is about to be published in the next part of the
<i>Antiquarian Etching Club</i>, of Fuller, the author of <i>Worthies</i>, <i>Church
History</i>, &amp;c., without a copy of his signature for the same reason,
unless one should be discovered.</p>

<p>It has been suggested that search made in the library of Queen's
College, Cambridge, might prove successful in both cases, from the fact
of their having both belonged to that college. Perhaps some member of
the university would kindly undertake the inquiry.</p>

<h3>
<span>COCKNEY.<br />
(Vol. iv., pp. 273. 318.)</span>
</h3>


<p>The following passages collected from various sources, will perhaps help
to illustrate the origin and the several meanings of this word
<i>Cockney</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>Fuller's first sense is&mdash;</p>


   <p class="blockquot">"One coaks'd or cockered, made a wanton or nestle-cock of,
   delicately bred and brought up, so that when grown men or women
   they can endure no hardship, nor comport with pains taking."</p>

  <p class="blockquot">"'Tis not their fault, but our mothers', our cockering mothers,
   who for their labour make us to be called <i>Cockneys</i>."&mdash;Dekker,
   <i>A Knight's Conjuring</i>, 1607.</p>


     <div class="poem">

 <p>"And when this jape is told another day
      I shall be halden a daffe or a <i>Cokenay</i>."</p>

     <p class="author"> Chaucer, <i>The Reve's Tale</i>.</p>

</div>


<p>The following extracts will show that to this first sense Fuller might
have added, <i>one abundantly and daintily fed:</i>&mdash;</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "Unlesse it be shortly considered, and that faukons be broughte
   to <i>a more homelye diete</i>, it is ryght likely, that within a
   shorte space of yeares, our familiar pultry shall be as scarse,
   as be now partriche and fesaunte. I speake not this in disprayse
   of the faukons, but of them whiche keepeth them lyke
   <i>Cokeneys</i>."&mdash;Elyot, <i>The Governour</i>, 1557.</p>

  <p class="blockquot">"Some again are in the other extreme, and draw this mischief on
   their heads by too ceremonious and strict diet, being over
   precise <i>cockney-like</i>, and curious in their observation of
   meats."&mdash;Burton. <i>Anatomy of Melancholy</i>.</p>

<p>Fuller's second sense is&mdash;</p>

  <p class="blockquot">  "One utterly ignorant of husbandry and huswifery such as is
   practised in the country, so that he may be easily persuaded
   anything about rural commodities, and the original thereof."</p>

<p>He relates the old <i>cock-neigh</i> story, and adds another jest of a
similar kind:</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "One merrily persuaded a she-citizen, that seeing <i>malt</i> did not
   grow, the good huswives in the country did spin it; 'I knew as
   much,' said the <i>Cockney</i>, 'for one may see the threads hang out
   at the ends thereof."</p>

<p>Shakspeare uses the word <i>Cockney</i> in this latter sense in <i>King Lear</i>,
Act II. Sc. 4.:</p>

  <p class="blockquot">"<i>Lear.</i> Oh me, my heart, my rising heart! But down."</p>

  <p class="blockquot">"<i>Fool.</i> Cry to it, nuncle, as the <i>Cockney</i> did to the eels,
   when she put 'em i' th' paste alive; she knapt 'em o' th'
   coxcombs with a stick, and cried 'Down, wantons, down;' 'twas her
   brother, that in pure kindness to his horse buttered his hay."</p>

<p><i>Cokeney</i> was apparently used in very early times to designate <i>London</i>.
In the <i>Britannia</i>, art. "Suffolk," Hugh Bigod, a rebellious baron in
the time of Henry II., boasts thus:</p>

<div class="poem">

     <p> "Were I in my castle of Bungey,</p>
      <p>Upon the river Waveney,</p>
     <p> I would ne care for the King of <i>Cockeney</i>."</p>

</div>

<p>I conceive that <i>Cokeney</i> in this sense is derived from the Anglo-Saxon
word <i>cycene</i>, a kitchen or cooking place. Nares, however, in his
<i>Glossary</i>, says:</p>

   <p class="blockquot">"Le pais de cocagne, in French, means a country of good cheer; in
   old French <i>coquaine</i>; cocagna, in Italian, has the same meaning.
   Both might be derived from <i>coquina</i>. This famous country, if it
   could be found, is described as a region 'where the hills were
   made of sugar-candy, and the loaves ran down the hills, crying
   'Come eat me, <i>come eat me</i>.'"</p>

<p>Hickes gives, in his <i>Anglo-Saxon Grammar</i>, an ancient poem, describing
the plenteous land of <i>Cokeney</i> or <i>Cokaigne</i>:</p>

<div class="poem">

     <p> "Fur in see hi west Spaynge</p>
     <p> Is a lond ihote Cocaygne</p>
     <p> Ther nis lond under hevenriche</p>
      <p>Of wel of goodnis hit iliche<a id="Page_476"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[476]</span></p>
      <p>In Cokaygne is met and drink</p>
    <p>  Withute care, how, and swink</p>
  <p>    .......</p>
    <p>  Ther nis lac of met no cloth</p>
      <p>.......</p>
    <p>  Ther beth rivers gret and fine</p>
      <p>Of oile, melk, honi and wine.</p>
    <p>  Water seruith ther to nothing</p>
      <p>Bot to siyt and to waussing.</p>
   <p>   .......</p>
      <p>Ther is a wel fair abbei</p>
     <p> Of white monkes and of grei</p>
     <p> .......</p>
     <p> The gees irostid on the spitte</p>
  <p>    Fleey to that abbai, god hit wot,</p>
  <p>    And gredith 'gees al hote, al hot.'"</p>

</div>

<p>Shakspeare's use of <i>Cockney</i>, in <i>Twelfth Night</i>, Act IV. Sc. 1., is
somewhat obscure; but I conceive that the Clown means to express his
opinion that the world is already replete with folly:</p>


<div class="poem">

  <p class="indh6"> "<i>Seb.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I prithee vent thy folly somewhere else; thou know'st not
   me.</p>

 <p class="indh6">   "<i>Clown.</i> Vent my folly! He has heard that word of some great
   man, and now applies it to a fool. Vent my folly! I am afraid
   this great lubber, the world, will prove a <i>Cockney</i>."</p>

</div>

<p>The Clown probably intends to say, that to vent his folly to the world
will be like sending coals to Newcastle, or provisions to <i>Cocagne</i>; for
that, as regards folly, this great lubber the world will prove to be a
<i>Cocagne</i> or <i>Cokeney</i>, <i>i.e.</i> a land of plenty. He may, however, mean
to hint, in a round-about way, that <i>Cockneys</i>, or natives of London,
are full of folly; or that the world is as well supplied with folly as a
<i>Cockney</i> is with food.</p>

<p>I do not know whether I committed a <i>Cockney</i>, a <i>clerical</i>, or a
<i>canonical</i> error, when I wrote the name of Chaucer under the following
lines instead of the word <i>Cokeney</i>:&mdash;</p>

 <div class="poem">

      <p>   "I have no peny, quod Pierce, polettes for to bie,</p>
      <p>Ne neither gose ne grys, but two grene cheses,</p>
      <p>    A few curdes and creame, and an haver cake,</p>
      <p> And two loves of beanes and branne, bake for mi folke,</p>
      <p>   And yet I say by my soule, I have no salt bacon</p>
      <p> Ne no <i>Cokeney</i>, by Christe, coloppes to make."</p>

      <p class="author"> <i>The Vision of Pierce Plowman</i>, printed 1550.</p>

</div>

 <div class="poem">

      <p> "At that fest thay wer seruyd with a ryche aray,</p>
      <p>Every fyve and fyve had a <i>Cokenay</i>."</p>

      <p class="author"> <i>The Turnament of Tottenham.</i></p>

</div>

<p>The sentence for which I am responsible, p. 318., should read thus:
"<i>Cokeney</i>, in the above lines quoted by Webster, probably refers to any
substantial dish of fresh meat which might be cut in collops." I may add
that this use of the word brings it into close alliance with the
Anglo-Saxon word <i>cocnunga</i>, signifying <i>things cooked</i>, <i>pies</i>,
<i>puddings</i>, and <i>cock's-meat</i>.</p>

<p>The French and Neapolitan festivals, called <i>cocagne</i> and <i>cocagna</i>,
appear to have presented themselves in this country under the form of
Cockneys' feasts and revels conducted by the King of Cockneys. Strype,
in the first appendix to his edition of Stow's <i>London</i>, under the head
"Stepney," describes at some length "The Cockney's Feast of Stepney;"
and Dugdale, in his <i>Origines Juridiciales</i>, recapitulates an order
entered on the <i>Register of Lincoln's Inn</i>, vol. iv. fo. 81a, in the 9th
of Henry VIII.:</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "That the <i>King of Cockneys</i> in Childermass-day should sit and
   have due service, and that he and all his officers should use
   honest and lawful manner and good order, without any waste of
   destruction making, in wine, brawn, chely, or other victuals: as
   also that he, his marshal, butler, and constable marshal, should
   have their lawful and honest commandments by delivery of the
   officers of Christmas: and that the said King of Cockneys, ne
   none of his officers, medyll neither in the buttry nor in the
   Stuard of Christmass his office&mdash;upon pain of xi<span class="topnum">s</span>. for every
   such medling. And lastly, that Jack Straw and all his adherents
   should be thenceforth utterly banisht, and no more to be used in
   this house upon pain to forfeit, for every time five pounds, to
   be levied on every fellow hapning to offend against this rule."</p>

<p>Some obliging bencher of Lincoln's Inn will perhaps have the goodness to
examine, or to permit me to examine the <i>Register</i>, to ascertain whether
this potentate was king of Cockneys, as Dugdale has it, or of Cockney.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>The Word Infortuner</i></span>
<span> (Vol. iv., p. 328.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;J. C. W. enquires, "Is
<i>infortuner</i> to be found in any old Dictionary?" I would state that I
have not been able to find it; but in Cockeram's <i>English Dictionarie</i>,
1639, I find "<i>Infortunate</i>, unhappy;" and in Bailey's <i>Dictionary</i>,
vol. i. 1753, "<i>Infortunate</i>, unhappy, unlucky;" "<i>Infortune</i>,
misfortune," referred to Chaucer; "<i>Infortunes</i>, an astrological term,
applied to Saturn and Mars, because of their unfortunate influences;"
"<i>Infortunid</i>, unfortunate," referred to Chaucer; and in vol. ii of
Bailey's <i>Dictionary</i>, 1727, I find "<i>Infortunateness</i>, unhappiness,
unluckiness." It is singular that Cockeram gives "infortunate" in his
first alphabet, which, he says, in his preface, "hath the <i>choicest</i>
words now in use, wherewith our language is enriched." "Unfortunate" he
places in the second alphabet, which, he says, "contains the <i>vulgar</i>
words." Neither Cole's <i>English Dictionary</i>, 1685, nor Blount's
<i>Glossographia</i>, 1670, nor Phillips' <i>World of Words</i>, 1678, contain the
word "unfortunate" in any of its terminations or applications. Mr.
Halliwell, in his <i>Dictionary of Provincial Words</i>, gives the word
"<i>Infortune</i>, misfortune," deriving it from the Anglo-Norman.</p>

<p>Whilst referring thus to our early lexicographers,<a id="Page_477"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[477]</span> allow me to
allude to an anecdote respecting, Dr. Adam Lyttleton, who, when
compiling his Latin Dictionary, announced the verb "concurro" to his
amanuensis; the latter, imagining, from an affinity of sound, that the
first two syllables gave the English meaning of the verb, said,
"<i>Concur</i>, I suppose, sir." To which the Doctor peevishly replied,
"<i>Concur</i>, condog." The scribe wrote down what he supposed his employer
dictated, and the word "condog" was inserted, and stands as one
interpretation of "concurro" in the first edition of the Dictionary; it
is, of course, expunged from subsequent ones. I give this statement as I
find it in print. I do not vouch for its correctness, not having the
first edition of the Dictionary to refer to. Strange to say, however,
"condog" was regarded as a synonym, or rather as an equivalent to
"concur," long before the date of the first edition of Dr. Lyttleton's
<i>Dictionary</i>. In Cockeram's <i>Dictionarie</i>, before referred to, sixth
edition, 1639, I find the second alphabet, among the words which the
author calls <i>vulgar</i>, the verb "to agree" defined "Concurre, cohere,
<i>condog</i>, condiscend." Cockeram's <i>Dictionary</i> was evidently a work of
some authority in its day; it was dedicated to Sir Richard Boyle, and
reached to, at least, a <i>sixth</i> edition, which edition is announced in
the title-page as "revised and enlarged," and therefore "condog" did not
owe its place in it to the error of an amanuensis or transcriber. The
book, although small, contains much curious matter, to which I may,
perhaps, hereafter refer. In his "premonition to the reader," he says,
"where thou meetest with a word marked thus +, know you that it is now
out of use, and only used of some ancient writers." Among these words
thus marked as obsolete in 1639, I find, on casually opening the book,
the following, "abandon, abate, bardes, insanity." He also defines <i>Troy
weight</i> as "a pound weight of twelve ounces, wherewith <i>bread</i>, precious
stones, gold and silver are weighed." Blount also (1670), and Cole
(1685), say bread was sold by Troy weight; the latter adds medicines to
the articles sold by that standard. Cowell, in his <i>Law Dictionary</i>
(1708), says, "Electuaries, and medicinal things, and <i>brede</i>, are to be
weighed by Troy weight;" Bayley, in 1753, says, "Gold, silver, drugs,"
&amp;c., are weighed by Troy weight, but does not enumerate bread. Can any
of your readers inform me when bread was first directed to be sold by
Troy weight, and when it ceased to be so?</p>

<span><i>Foreign Ambassadors</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. iv., p. 442.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;There is a list of French
ambassadors, envoys, ministers, and other political agents at the court
of England, in the <i>Annuaire</i> of the Société de l'histoire de France for
1848, which is the twelfth volume of the series. The list commences in
1396, and is continued to 1830.</p>

<p>I believe there is a copy of this most useful publication in the British
Museum. If so, it should appear in the <i>experimental</i> catalogue of 1841,

<span><i>Petition for the Recall from Spain of the Duke of Wellington</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. iv., p. 233.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Æ<span class="smcap lowercase">GROTUS</span> asked if a copy of the petition to the above
effect from the Corporation of London to the Crown can be found, as it
is a droll historical document, which should not sink into oblivion; he
jumps at the conclusion that it does exist, but I think is mistaken.
Through the kindness of a friend who is in the Corporation, I have had
the journals searched, and have not been successful in finding any
address to the above tenor. There are abundance congratulating the
Prince Regent on the successes of the Duke, but none of censure. I have
likewise ascertained that some of the oldest servants of the City feel
quite sure that no such address was ever carried. If
 Æ<span class="smcap lowercase">GROTUS</span> can give me
any grounds for his belief, or anything likely to aid my inquiry, I will
renew the search.</p>

<span>NOTES ON BOOKS, SALES, CATALOGUES, ETC.</span>
</h3>


<p>If any doubt could exist as to the value of the <i>Germania</i> of Tacitus,
as an invaluable contribution to the history of all the Teutonic races,
a glance at the Appendix to Klemm's <i>Germanische Altherthumskunde</i>, in
which that author has enumerated not only the best editions and
translations of the <i>Germania</i>, but also the most important
dissertations to which it has given rise, would at once dispel it. The
scholar and the antiquary of this country may therefore be congratulated
on the fact of Dr. Latham having prepared an edition of it, which has
been issued under the title of <i>The Germania of Tacitus, with
Ethnological Dissertations and Notes</i>. Although "the work," to use Dr.
Latham's own words, "is rather a commentary upon the geographical part
of the <i>Germania</i>, than on the <i>Germania</i> itself&mdash;the purely descriptive
part relating to the customs of the early Germans being passed over
almost <i>sicco pede</i>,"&mdash;yet our readers will have no difficulty in
estimating its importance, when we inform them that the Ethnological
Dissertations and Notes which accompany the text may be said to embody
the views, (ofttimes indeed dissented from by Dr. Latham,) of Grimm and
Zeuss, and the learning with which those distinguished men have
illustrated the subject. Indeed, Dr. Latham, who sets an example of
openly acknowledging his obligations to other scholars which we should
be glad to see more generally followed, expressly states, that whether
the work before us took its present form, or that of a translation with
an elaborate commentary of Zeuss's learned and indispensable work, <i>Die
Deutschen und die Nachbarstämme</i>, was a mere question of
convenience.<a id="Page_478"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[478]</span></p>

<p>If the story that we have heard be true, namely, that one of the most
learned and active members of the episcopal bench did, at a late
clerical meeting, hold up a copy of Whitaker's <i>Clergyman's Diary and
Ecclesiastical Directory</i>, and pronounce it to be a little book so full
of useful and invaluable information as to be indispensable to every
clergyman, it is clear that the work is beyond all criticism.</p>

<p><i>The Family Almanack and Educational Register for 1852</i>, contains&mdash;in
addition to full particulars of nearly a thousand public schools,
colleges, and universities, and a list (containing upwards of a
thousand) of the principal private schools in the kingdom,&mdash;a vast
amount of miscellaneous information (including for the first time the
Statutes of the Irish University) and statistical tables, and so forms a
volume which no person interested in the great question of education can
at all do without.</p>

<p>While on the subject of education, we may acknowledge the receipt of
several educational works, which we can only notice with great brevity.</p>

<p>M. Merlet's <i>Dictionary of French Difficulties</i> (which, but that the
subject is almost too grave for such a jest, we should have suggested
might very appropriately have been dedicated to the President) bears on
its title the stamp of its merit in the words "<i>third edition</i>."</p>

<p>M. Falch Lebahn's <i>Self Instructor in German</i>; <i>Practice in German</i>; and
<i>German in One Volume</i> (4th ed.), are very able attempts to facilitate
the study of that most useful language.</p>

<p>The last work, containing as it does La Motte Fouque's beautiful tale of
<i>Undine</i>, with explanatory notes on all the difficult words and phrases,
and its vocabulary of 4500 words synonymous in German and English,
cannot be found otherwise than most useful.</p>

<p>"<i>Our correspondents will see, on very little reflection, that it is

earliest insertion possible, because we cannot explain to them, as we
could to those to whom we are known, the reasons for delay.)&mdash;that for
the delay or non-insertion of their communications there are always what
we believe they would admit to be satisfactory reasons if they were but
acquainted with them; although, from the difficulty attendant on the
management of a work like the present, we are not able to bring those
reasons before them.</i></p>

<p class="center xx-large">THE LITERARY GAZETTE</p>

<p class="center larger">IS ENLARGED,</p>

<p class="center">FOR THE PURPOSES OF</p>

<p class="center2">SCIENCE, FINE ARTS, MUSIC, AND THE DRAMA.</p>

<div class="boxad1"><p>The Proprietors of "THE LITERARY GAZETTE," impressed with a conviction
that it was not possible to treat efficiently of Literature, Science,
Fine Arts, Music, and the Drama, within the limits of a paper of sixteen
pages, resolved, at the commencement of their undertaking in January
last, to devote the Journal exclusively to the interests of Literature.
As the season arrived for the Exhibitions of Pictures, it was found
necessary, in compliance with the wishes of many Subscribers, to give
Critical Notices of them; but these were insufficient to mark the
progress of Fine Arts, while they intrenched upon the space intended for
Literature. The insertion of Reviews of Scientific Works elicited also
complaints that the Reports of the Learned Societies should have been
relinquished, and it has been felt that a weekly record of the progress
of Science is still a desideratum.</p>

<p>Encouraged by the success that has attended their efforts in the
department of Literature (the circulation of "THE LITERARY GAZETTE,"
notwithstanding these deficiencies, having been more than doubled), the
Proprietors have determined to enlarge their Journal to twenty-four
pages, and to devote the additional space to special departments of
Science, Fine Arts, Music, and the Drama.</p>
</div>


<div class="boxad1">
<p>The contents of "THE LITERARY GAZETTE" will henceforth be arranged as
follows:&mdash;</p>

Works, and occasionally of Foreign Works.</p>

<p class="noindent cap">The elegant manner in which these well-known Books are got up, renders
them especially eligible as PRESENTATION COPIES of the "Sacred
Scriptures." Bound in Bagster's peculiar style of flexible Turkey
morocco, of durable beauty, and enriched with every external adornment,
the typographical completeness is enhanced. The Miniature Polyglot, or
small pocket size, the Foolscap Octavo, pocket size, and the Facsimile
Large-Print Edition, all correspond page for page; and in their
combinations with the Book of Common Prayer, Indexes, Concordances,
Lexicons, etc., afford a variety suited to every requirement. The
"Comprehensive Family and Pulpit Bible," containing the largest number
of parallel references and illustrative notes ever published, is kept,
of various quarto sizes, bound up with Family Registers, in plain and
sumptuous bindings. The "Hexapla" is a treasury of the most condensed
criticism. It consists of the Greek Text of the New Testament, printed
in the largest type, with six standard English translations beneath it,
arranged for comparison in parallel columns. Kept in every style of best
binding. "The Bible of Every Land," now just completed, is a collection
of interesting Memoirs of every Language into which the Bible has been
translated, with engraved Specimens, numerous coloured Maps, and a full
series of Native Alphabets. "The Blank-Paged Bible," "The Biblia
Ecclesiæ Polyglotta," "The Large-Print Critical Greek Testament and
Septuagint" may also be suggested as suitable gifts. See descriptive
Catalogues, which are furnished without charge, and sent free by post.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
